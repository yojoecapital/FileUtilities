## Settings JSON

This is an example of how the settings JSON may look like. You can use `fs open` to open the JSON.

```json
{
  "scriptsPath": "scripts",
  "endBlock":  "</done>",
  "methods": {
    "cmd": {
      "path": "cmd.exe",
      "setup": ["/c"],
      "extension": "bat"
    },
    "ps": {
      "path": "pwsh.exe",
      "extension": "ps1"
    },
    "py": {
      "path": "python.exe",
      "extension": "py"
    }
  }
}
```

### JSON Fields

- `"scriptsPath"`: The path to the script items. You can use this to save the scripts to a different directory, such as a shared directory. Make sure the directory is used exclusively for script items.
- `"endBlock"`: This is the token to end multiline input when running `fs make script`.
- `"methods"`: These are methods used to execute a script item.
  - `"path"`: What should execute the script.
  - `"setup"`: Pre-arguments such as `/c` for `cmd.exe`.
  - `"extension"`: What file extension should be used when saving the script item's file.
